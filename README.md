## Getting Started

## How to Clone/Download files:
In order to get the full files from this repository simply follow the following steps:

Figure 1.1 ![alt text](https://github.com/Shinesheray/readme-images/blob/main/Download_files.jpeg?raw=true)

* If you do not have Git installed on your local machine you can simply click on the ‘code’ button and there will be an option to download Zip file as seen in the screenshot above. Download the folder and extract all files. Now all the files are on your local machine


* If you do have Git installed you can click on the ‘code’ button as well and simply select to copy the HTTPS URL link as seen in figure 1.1 above. Now open the Git command  line and type in “got clone” and past the copied repo URL and press enter. The files are now downloaded/installed onto your local machine

You can watch this youtube tutorial if you having any issue’s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKcqniGu3tA&ab_channel=CodingForEverybody 

 
## Now that the files are on your machine lets run the app Local

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
